title: Settlement
---

After the pair is settled, we can settle our shares to get margins back from AMM and settle all our positions according to the settlement price in the [Account page](https://kovan.synfutures.com/#/account) to withdraw all margins from the pair. 

For our example above, after QQQ-DAI-20210430-UNI pair matures, "Operations” for this pair in the account page "Operations” for this pair will become "Settle” instead of "Deposit/Withdraw” as shown currently in the following pictures.
