title: Experience our Kovan testnet
---

SynFutures is a decentralized derivatives platform that allows various digital assets pairs to be freely created and traded. This tutorial will show you how to create a fresh new futures market on SynFutures corresponding to the spot market in Uniswap V2 with our dapp deployed on [kovan testnet](https://kovan.synfutures.com).

SynFutures@v1 can use any on-chain asset as quote, but we decided to start with ETH, DAI, USDC and USDT. This should be enough for most scenarios given the current status of Uniswap V2. 

To facilitate test on kovan network, we deployed ERC20 tokens with symbols [USDC](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0x51D102A0203999110BC13B1ddf1c78566C02040A), [USDT](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0x2568d37520C08Ecc772f5feb9705e7b8Ca248535), and [DAI](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0x815343B0FcA4f9b49c89118E66b21fBFCA51b3Eb) to restore mainnet experience. To play with our app, you can apply some tokens at the [Account page](https://kovan.synfutures.com/#/account). Of course, you need to acquire some kovan eth from the [kovan testnet faucet](https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet) to pay for the gas.
